# Network-Router
Simulated network packet processing queue
This program takes in simulated network packets and processes the packets through a linked list. This program uses: dynamic memory, linked list, queues, file input, classes, templating, and data filtering.
Packets are read in through a txt file and then processesd to create a "NetworkPacket" object. Those objects are then sorted based on their content as well as scanned for suspicious input/blocked addresses. A linked list is used as the queue to demonstrate a "first-in first-out" approach to handling data. Templating was added afterwords to allow for multiple data types, different from the NetworkPacket object.
